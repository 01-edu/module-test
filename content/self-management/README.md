## Self-Management

### Your Challenge: Mastering Your Inner World

Welcome to your first project in the [Lifeskills journey](https://01edu.notion.site/The-Lifeskills-Story-Your-Challenge-to-Grow-2fcee5a1098a80fbbd00f2053f28ee72?source=copy_link). Before you can lead others or collaborate effectively, you must first learn to lead yourself. Self-management is the foundation of personal effectiveness - it's about controlling your responses to pressure, organizing your time wisely, and taking ownership of your own development.

This project focuses on three core self-management skills: stress management, time management, and self-reliance. You'll explore these through self-directed learning and validate your understanding through a QCM assessment.

### Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Learn techniques to manage stress and regulate your emotions effectively
- Master prioritization and organizational strategies to use time efficiently
- Develop autonomy and initiative to work independently without constant guidance
- Build daily habits that support long-term personal effectiveness
- Identify your personal triggers and develop coping strategies

### Instructions

Study the provided resources for each skill area, use the AI learning prompts to deepen your understanding, complete the required Alison course, and validate your knowledge through a QCM.

> The assessment will eventually be integrated directly into the platform as a quiz. For now, this format is used to collect initial feedback and refine the questions.
