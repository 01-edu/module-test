## Communication and Interaction

### Your Challenge: Connecting Through Words and Listening

Communication is the bridge that connects you to others. Whether you're presenting ideas, collaborating on projects, or simply having a conversation, your ability to express yourself clearly and listen actively determines the quality of your interactions. This project develops these essential skills.

This project focuses on two interconnected communication skills: verbal communication and active listening. You'll explore these through self-directed learning and validate your understanding through a QCM assessment.

### Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Develop the ability to speak clearly and effectively in various contexts
- Learn to structure your messages for maximum clarity and impact
- Master active listening techniques to truly understand others
- Practice paraphrasing and reflecting to confirm understanding
- Build awareness of how you communicate and where you can improve

### Instructions

Study the provided resources for each skill area, use the AI learning prompts to deepen your understanding, complete the required Alison course, and validate your knowledge through a QCM.

> The assessment will eventually be integrated directly into the platform as a quiz. For now, this format is used to collect initial feedback and refine the questions.
