## Positive Values and Attitudes

### Your Challenge: Cultivating the Mindset for Growth

The most successful professionals aren't just skilled - they possess attitudes and values that make them exceptional teammates, learners, and human beings. This project focuses on developing the inner qualities that will set you apart: curiosity that drives continuous learning, respect for diversity that enables collaboration, and kindness that builds lasting relationships.

This project focuses on three core values: curiosity, respect for diversity, and kindness. You'll explore these through self-directed learning and validate your understanding through a QCM assessment and an oral audit where you'll demonstrate how these values interconnect and apply to real-world situations.

### Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Foster a willingness to learn and ask questions to deepen your knowledge
- Develop awareness and appreciation for differences in others
- Cultivate empathy and a positive attitude toward those around you
- Build habits that support inclusive and supportive environments
- Understand how these values contribute to personal and professional success
- Recognize how curiosity, diversity, and kindness work together to create exceptional teamwork

### Instructions

Study the provided resources for each value area, use the AI learning prompts to deepen your understanding, complete the required Alison course, and validate your knowledge through a QCM.

> Later on, the assessment will be through a quiz integration in the platform, for now this quiz format is used to collect initial feedback and improve the questions.
